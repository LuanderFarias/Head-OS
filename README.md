<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Head OS Is a project for my tv head cosplay that i would like to share with everyone, My tv head project basically uses a computer screen, a camera and some led lights to bring emotions to my tv head display. The display is transparent so you can see through it, that works by basically dismonting a notenook screen and using the whole box as it backlight.

If you want to do your own tv head like i did just follow the <a href="/documentation.md">Docs</a>
